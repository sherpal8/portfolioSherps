# Sherpal's Portfolio

This is the code to my portfolio that can be viewed at: [https://dharmawebdesign.co.uk/portS/](https://dharmawebdesign.co.uk/portS/)

I utilised HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript service workers, and Adobe Photoshop to carefully animate photos. User input is sanitised using PHP.

Block-Element-Modifier convention was used for the CSS naming convention. ARIA label is used. I used Chrome lighthouse to audit the site and then made the appropriate corrections. The site is responsive and is built mobile-first.

Thank you for checking it out.
